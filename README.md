This Python code is an implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game using sockets for network communication between two players. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. Import Statements: Imports necessary modules including tkinter for GUI, socket for network communication, and PIL for image handling.

2. Player1 Class: Initializes the GUI for Player 1 to enter connection details.
Provides methods to establish a connection with Player 2 (GetConnected method).
Provides a method to send the username to the connected Player 2.

3. GameStart Function: Starts the game once the connection is established.

4. GUI Class: Inherits from Player1.
Initializes the GUI for the Tic Tac Toe game for Player 1.
Sets up the game board with buttons for making moves.
Implements logic for marking X and O on the board, sending moves to the opponent, and checking for a win condition.
Provides a method to handle the end of the game, allowing players to play again or quit.

5. main Block: Creates an instance of Player1.
Starts the game.

This code facilitates a multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game where Player 1 initiates the connection, sets up the game board, makes moves, and communicates with Player 2 over the network. Player 2 would typically run a similar script to connect and play against Player 1.
